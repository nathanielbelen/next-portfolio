# # introduction

Recently I was contracted to build a <a href='https://edwardhosharian.org'>website</a> for a non-profit. For the homepage, the client requested a vertical slider whose individual slides slide off the screen one by one. A video of the finished component is below:

<Video path={'/slider.mp4'} />

# problem

I couldn't find a suitable library that fit the client's request that also allowed for commercial usage. I ended up having to build the component. Here's my implementation and some details on what I kept in mind when building the component.

The functionality of the component:

+ for every slide, the website should scroll exactly 1 screen height before veing removed from the screen

+ the client requested that the body content below the slider be visible on screen

+ there should be a key dots representing each slide



- pass down viewportheight, scrollposition



```javascript
const Banner = ({ slides, scrollPosition, viewportHeight }) => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{ height: `${slides.length * 100}vh` }}
    >
      {slides.map((slideData, index) => {
        const slideTopPosition = index * viewportHeight;
        const isSlideFixed = scrollPosition <= slideTopPosition;
        return (
          <Slide
            fixed={isSlideFixed}
            slideIndex={index + 1}
            top={slideTopPosition}
            key={`slide-${index}`}
          />
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};
```
