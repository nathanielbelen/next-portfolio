# # showcase

Recently I was contracted to build a website for a non-profit. The Edward Hosharian Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting Armenian music, culture, and education, with a particular emphasis on promoting the legacy of Armenian-American composer Edward Hosharian.

# # explained

The website is built on Next.js and hosted on Vercel. I used Sanity.io as a headless CMS, which provides both content management and an easy-to-use dashboard for the nonprofit to edit content themselves. The website features multiple pages, including 3 dynamic routes dealing with the foundation's events, blog posts, and media.

# # technical notes

There are still some items that need to be addressed that didnâ€™t make it into the MVP. I need to fix the Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) at the beginning of the page, and I also need to improve image responsiveness, as the images currently loaded are quite large.
