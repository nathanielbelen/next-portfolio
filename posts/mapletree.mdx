# # showcase

I built an application that showcases links for an individual in the style of the old computer game *MapleStory*. It was built with vanilla javascript and is hosted on netlify. I had originally made it personally for a friend, but after receiving a lot of inquiries on custom personalized websites, I began selling them to others. I currently host about 30 'mapletrees,' most of which pay a monthly fee for upkeep and hosting costs.

# # explained

The application uses assets from the game *MapleStory*, all bundled together to mimic functionality of the original game using JavaScript. It features a 'character info' box, which has elements replaced with outbound links to an individual's personal accounts. It also features a personalized character that walks left and right in random intervals/distances, also mimicing the movement of the original game. Individuals are able to modify content through a dashboard that is hooked up to an EC2 instance running an Express server with SQLite.
